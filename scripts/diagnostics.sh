# Raspberry Pi OS keeps the journal in RAM and discards core dumps, so a crash
# leaves nothing to work from: on player1 a SIGSEGV flooded the 15 MB RAM buffer
# with retry errors and rotated the crash itself out of history before anyone
# looked.  This turns on:
#
#   * a persistent journal, capped (survives reboots; 25 MB of retry spam can no
#     longer push out the interesting part)
#   * systemd-coredump, capped (a real backtrace via `coredumpctl info piplayer`)
#
# Both are size-limited so they cannot fill the SD card.  Undo with
# --disable, which restores the stock behaviour.
